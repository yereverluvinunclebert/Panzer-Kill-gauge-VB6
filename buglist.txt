' add pin 'widget' layer as a trial with a function, change of image and a sound, size, opacity properties that match the globe
' add logic to each of the graphic controls - WIP

' Problems Widget layers:

' When you have multiple widgets, one for each layer that needs to act as a control,
' the topmost layer takes all the clicks even if the layer has transparency. It does
' not pass it down to the widget below. Each layer is a virtual rectangular layer
' that acts as if it is fully opaque and not transparent at all. ie. Clicks don't
' fall through transparency to the layer below as I am accustomed to with YWE and Xw.

' Problems W_HitTest regions:

' Using RC widgets, you can add a W_HitTest function that matches a bordered region
' such as an arc that forms a full circle or an ellipse/rectangle &c. It will test 
' successfully for a mouse event if you do this and also remember to set:
'              W.ImplementsHitTest = True.
'
' However, the pain of having to draw a region for every area that needs to be
' active using ellipses, arcs or rectangles to respond to a hittest is primitive 
' and worse than that, would be painful to set up.
'
' In any case, that is not possible, the trouble is, a hitTest will ONLY respond to
' mouse events within that single defined region. All other mouse interactions 
' outside the area are ignored. That's useless to a program that needs multiple
' areas to respond to. You cannot set up multiple hitTest areas to respond to 
' hit events.

' The standard mouseDown can report X and Y positions but you would have to test
' the values manually for every layer/area. Not practical.

' OUTCOME:

' RC5 is not currently suitable for creating desktop programs emulating Y widgets
' that need to have interacting regions. It is only suitable for clocks or for
' programs that can be controlled via menus and complex preferences.
'
' To overcome this limitation I would have to create a RC widget class for 
' each item that needs to respond to user interaction. Each would be a virtual 
' rectangle acting as if it was actually opaque. The rectangles cannot overlap.
' it might be worth doing for one or two controls but for a Ywidget equivalent
' with multiple interacting regions it is completely unsuitable.
