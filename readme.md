# Panzer-Kill-gauge-VB6

A FOSS Kill Gauge VB6 Widget for Reactos, XP, Win7, 8 and 10+.
 
The Panzer Kill Gauge VB6 gauge is a simple utility displaying a process kill Gauge in a
dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed anywhere on 
your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your desktop a 
dieselpunk make-over. 

I use it to kill a wayward process. I used to run a lot of Yahoo Widgets and 
occasionally the Konfabulator engine would get itself in a twist and start 
continually dying/reloading. I had this exact widget on my desktop (written 
in MS Jscript for the Xwidget engine) and whenever YWE did a funny I would 
dblClick on the Kill button and YWE would die. When you are developing it is 
not unsusual to create a rogue program that needs to be killed regularly. Use 
this tool to do it.

In amomgst the code is a binary that you will be able to use to install the 
desktop widget. It is SETUP.EXE, when the program is ready I will create this 
installer, until then this a work in progress.

This widgets UI functionality is limited as I am using my simple template for 
widgets yet to come. However, it can be increased in size, opacity/transparency 
may be set as to the users discretion. The widget can also be made to hide for 
a pre-determined period.

Right-click on the widget to display the function menu, mouse hover over the 
widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works well on Windows XP 
to Windows 11 as well as Linux and Mac os x with Wine.

The Panzer Kill Gauge VB6 gauge is Beta-grade software, under development, not yet 
ready to use on a production system - use at your own risk.

This version was developed on Windows 7 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS 
project creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop. 

It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and 
community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created
by anyone. The first step was the creation of this template program to form the 
basis for the conversion of other desktop utilities or widgets. A future step 
is new VB6 widgets with more functionality and then hopefully, conversion of 
each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and 64bit-ness. 

This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets. That you can 
find here on Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery

I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software 
enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to 
contribute.

CREDITS:

I have really tried to maintain the credits as the project has progressed. If I 
have made a mistake and left someone out then do forgive me. I will make amends 
if anyone points out my mistake in leaving someone out.

MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s and 
early 2000s. Thanks for VB6.

Olaf Schmidt    - This tool was built using the RichClient RC5 Cairo wrapper for 
VB6. Specifically the components using transparency. Thanks for the massive 
effort Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for all VB6 native controls and 
giving us access to advanced features on controls such as transparency.

Shuja Ali @ codeguru for his settings.ini code.

ALLAPI.COM        For the registry reading code.

OCX - http://forums.codeguru.com/member.php?92278-rxbagain

si_the_geek       for his special folder code

Elroy on VB forums for the balloon tooltips

Harry Whitfield for his quality testing, brain stimulation and being an 
unwitting source of inspiration.

Tested on :

	ReactOS 0.4.14 32bit on virtualBox  
	windows 7 professional 32bit on intel  
	windows 7 ultimate 64bit on intel  
	windows 7 professional 64bit on intel  
	windows xp sp3 32bit on intel   
	windows 10 home 64bit on intel  
	windows 10 home 64bit on amd  
	windows 11 64bit on intel   

Dependencies:

A windows-alike o/s such as Windows XP, 7-11 or Apple Mac OSX 11.   

Requires a PzKill Gauge folder in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ 
eg: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\PzKill Gauge
Requires a settings.ini file to exist in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\PzKill Gauge
The above will be created automatically by the compiled program when run for the 
first time.

Uses just one OCX control extracted from Krools mega pack (slider). This is part 
of Krools replacement for the whole of Microsoft Windows Common Controls found 
in mscomctl.ocx. The slider control OCX file is shipped with this package.

* CCRSlider.ocx

This OCX will reside in the program folder. The program reference to this OCX is 
contained within the supplied resource file Panzer Kill Gauge Gauge.RES. It is 
compiled into the binary.

* OLEGuids.tlb

This is a type library that defines types, object interfaces, and more specific 
API definitions needed for COM interop / marshalling. It is only used at design 
time (IDE). This is a Krool-modified version of the original .tlb from the 
vbaccelerator website. The .tlb is compiled into the executable.
For the compiled .exe this is NOT a dependency, only during design time.

From the command line, copy the tlb to a central location (system32 or wow64 
folder) and register it.

COPY OLEGUIDS.TLB %SystemRoot%\System32\
REGTLIB %SystemRoot%\System32\OLEGUIDS.TLB

In the VB6 IDE - project - references - browse - select the OLEGuids.tlb

* Uses the RC5 Cairo wrapper from Olaf Schmidt.

During development the RC5 components need to be registered. These scripts are 
used to register. Run each by double-clicking on them.

RegisterRC5inPlace.vbs
RegisterVBWidgetsInPlace.vbs

During runtime on the users system, the RC5 components are dynamically 
referenced using modRC5regfree.bas which is compiled into the binary.

* SETUP.EXE - The program is currently distributed using setup2go, a very useful 
and comprehensive installer program that builds a .exe installer. Youll have to 
find a copy of setup2go on the web as it is now abandonware. Contact me
directly for a copy. The file "install PzKill Gauge 0.1.0.s2g" is the configuration 
file for setup2go. When you build it will report any errors in the build.

* HELP.CHM - the program documentation is built using the NVU HTML editor and 
compiled using the Microsoft supplied CHM builder tools (HTMLHelp Workshop) and 
the HTM2CHM tool from Yaroslav Kirillov. Both are abandonware but still do
the job admirably. The HTML files exist alongside the compiled CHM file in the 
HELP folder.
